# Galactic Tic-Tac-Toe
Around the year 7500 AD, the Milky Way has been largely colonized by humans (and now derivative sub-species that have started to drift from the original genetic line). Thousands of worlds lie within the borders of the Galactic Empire, governed by a planet-sized city called Deidrus. People travel in starships powered by jump drives that can bend space, allowing for near instantaneous travel over vast distances.

# Story
## Formation of the Mining Consortium
The crew of the Star Reclaimer are tired of the boot of the empire taxing their profits to oblivion in the outer reaches of the galaxy. After surviving a pirate raid (which should have been avoided, if the empire held up its security guarantees), they decide to visit other mining groups in the planets near their homeworld, Freehold, and try to convince them to join together into a mining consortium. They run into Jada Amraha of the mining ship Far Star. She agrees to join, if the Star Reclaimer can beat her in a game of tic-tac-toe.

## Game Start
- Players create a character with a name, origin, background, and a profession (from the list).

## Mechanics
- Each round, an alternating player can choose an unoccupied space on a 3x3 board to place their team's token.
- Then, Jada Amraha will place her token on the board, and make some snarky comment.
- The game ends when one side wins via standard tic-tac-toe rules.
- During the player's turn, any player can use their ability. Only one ability can be used per turn, and each player can only use their ability once in the entire game.

## Professions
### Miner
- Skill: Mining Laser: Can knock any token one square to the right (wraps around if at the edge of the board)
### Pilot
- Skill: Jump Drive: If activated, the players get the option to undo Jada's subsequent move and re-do their move this turn.
### Soldier
- Skill: Laser Rifle: Destroys 1 chosen enemy token on the board
