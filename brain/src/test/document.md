# Galactic Expanse
Around the year 7500 AD, the Milky Way has been largely colonized by humans (and now derivative sub-species that have started to drift from the original genetic line). Thousands of worlds lie within the borders of the Galactic Empire, governed by a planet-sized city called Deidrus. People travel in starships powered by jump drives that can bend space, allowing for near instantaneous travel over vast distances.

# Story
## Formation of the Mining Consortium
The crew of the Star Reclaimer are tired of the boot of the empire taxing their profits to oblivion in the outer reaches of the galaxy. After surviving a pirate raid (which should have been avoided, if the empire held up its security guarantees), they decide to visit other mining groups in the planets near their homeworld, Freehold, and try to convince them to join together into a mining consortium. They will likely have to do some things for them in order to gain their favor, and pave the way for the beginning of this new union.
